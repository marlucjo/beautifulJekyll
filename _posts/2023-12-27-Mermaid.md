Mermaid.js is a JavaScript library that provides an easy-to-use syntax for creating various types of diagrams and flowcharts. Its versatility makes it suitable for use in technical writing, software development, and other professional contexts where visualizing complex information is necessary.

### Config

You'll need to update your ``_config.yml`` with the location of the mermaid source javascript file you want to use.

```txt
mermaid:
  src: 'path/to/mermaid.js'
```

### Usage
Simply include the jekyll-mermaid block helper in any of your templates.

```txt
{% mermaid %}
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
{% endmermaid %}
```
